Hello! My name is Aryan, and I am currently a high school junior from Coppell, Texas in the US. As I am writing this post, it is a gloomy afternoon in January, and I had an impulse to write a blog post. I'm not sure where this blog may go or how it may look. However, I am excited about the impending journey and wherever it leads! Without further ado, here goes the Q & A...

### Why did you start this blog?

There are several distinct reasons for starting this blog, so I'll elaborate on each one:

1. Throughout my journey in STEM, I've encountered numerous challenges, and believe I can help other students with limited access to resources. By sharing my experiences and the lessons I've learned, I hope to provide guidance and support to those who may be struggling in similar situations.
    
2. I've developed interests in fields that aren't readily taughtâ€”electric vehicles and website development. However, these fields significantly impact our society through the Internet and transportation. By exploring these topics on my blog, I aim to raise awareness and spark discussions about their importance and potential for shaping our future.
    
3. Everyone has a unique perspective shaped by their background and experiences. I'd like to share the events that have influenced me through my writing. By doing so, I hope to connect with others who share similar interests or have faced similar challenges, fostering a sense of community and understanding.
    
4. I feel that, as a society, we have lost the importance of writing down our thoughts and reflecting. I aim to reignite its significance by demonstrating the value of introspection and self-expression through my blog. By sharing my thoughts and experiences, I hope to inspire others to do the same, fostering a culture of reflection and personal growth.
    
5. I want to document my high school journey so that I can look back in 5 years and smile at my younger self's words, realizing how far I've come. By chronicling my experiences, successes, and failures, I hope to create a tangible record of my personal growth and development, serving as a reminder of the challenges I've overcome and the lessons I've learned along the way.
    

### How did you design the website to host the blog?

The blog website is built using a design provided by Hashnode, a global community platform for developers to connect, share knowledge, and learn from one another. As of now, I haven't made many additional design changes to the website (although this may change if you're reading the blog at a later date). I opted for Hashnode over creating my own website from scratch because it already includes all the essential components for a blog site and offers a thriving community for engagement and networking.

In the future, I plan to further customize the website to make it truly unique and reflective of my personal style. This will involve adding custom design elements, adjusting the layout, and possibly incorporating interactive features to enhance the user experience.

If you have any questions about website development in general or are interested in having a website built, please don't hesitate to reach out through the contact form! I have also initiated other projects aimed at teaching website development and using it as a tool to benefit the community, such as the [Coppell Web Dev Club](https://coppellwebdev.github.io).

For those considering starting a STEM blog but unsure about website development, I wholeheartedly recommend Hashnode as a user-friendly and feature-rich platform to kickstart your blogging journey!

### What's your favorite thing about writing?

One of the things I love about blogging is the freedom it gives me to express myself. It's a thrilling journey of discovery where I can dive deep into topics that fascinate me, break them down, and share my thoughts with the world. I can't even begin to express the joy I feel when I hit that 'publish' button and my words, my thoughts, and my experiences are out there for everyone to see. It's like giving a piece of myself to the world, and in return, I get to connect with others, learn from their experiences, and grow as a person. Every blog post is a new adventure, a new story to tell, and I am beyond excited about where this journey is taking me!

### What's your least favorite thing about writing?

Despite my passion for blogging, there's one aspect that I expect to be a challenge - the pressure of consistency. The anticipation of keeping up with a regular posting schedule, ensuring each post is as engaging as the last, may sometimes feel overwhelming. It's like a race against the clock, a constant battle with the blank page. But, in all honesty, it's this very challenge that makes the process even more exhilarating. It pushes me to step out of my comfort zone, think on my feet, and strive for improvement continuously. So, even my least favorite thing about blogging ends up being a catalyst for growth and creativity. And that's the beauty of it!

### Why do you want to be an engineer & entrepreneur?

My aspiration to become an engineer, specifically in the field of autonomous vehicle technology, is driven by my fascination with the convergence of software and hardware to create intelligent systems. The idea of designing and developing technologies that can revolutionize transportation, improve safety, and contribute to a more sustainable future deeply excites me.

Being an entrepreneur complements my engineering aspirations, as it allows me to transform these innovative technologies into viable business solutions. The cross-section of engineering and entrepreneurship is where cutting-edge innovations meet market needs, creating a unique value proposition. It's the thrill of leading teams, navigating business challenges, and bringing these technological solutions to market that draws me towards entrepreneurship.
