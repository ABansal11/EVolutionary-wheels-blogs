Have you ever searched your Google Drive for a specific document using its name? Well, just today I was looking for an assignment starting with "homework." As I typed in "h", I didn't see the assignment, so I scrolled to the bottom. There, I found a peculiar document titled "haiku" that was last edited on February 6, 2015.

Sure enough, it was a Haiku that exemplified my obsession with protecting endangered animals at the time. So here it is!

### **The Black Spider Monkey Haiku**

**Black Spider Monkey**

**Super extremely unique**

Â Â Â  Â  **Endangered species**Â  Â  Â 

Let's be real...is it the best poetry you've ever heard? Well, it's actually far from it.

Nevertheless, it took me back to my interests from almost a decade ago. Reading the haiku prompted me to read about the Black Spider Monkey which I didn't even know existed.

Their status is vulnerable according to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/black-spider-monkey" style="pointer-events: none">WWF.</a></div>

Considering how my interests have developed in these last eight years, who knows what I might be doing another decade from now!
