Have you ever found yourself rummaging through your Google Drive, trying to locate a specific document by its name? I had a similar experience just today. I was on the hunt for an assignment that began with the word "*homework*." As I started typing the letter "*h*" into the search bar, I expected to see my desired document pop up. However, it was nowhere to be found. So, I decided to scroll all the way to the bottom of the search results, hoping it would appear.

To my surprise, I stumbled upon a peculiar document with the title "haiku" (written in all lowercase letters). What caught my attention was the fact that this mysterious file had been last edited quite some time ago, on February 6, 2015. This unexpected discovery piqued my curiosity, and I couldn't help but wonder what the content of this long-forgotten document might be.

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>What's a Haiku?</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">a Japanese poem of seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five, traditionally evoking images of the natural world.</div></details>

Sure enough, it was a three-line poem that I spent an entire day writing at the time. So here it is!

### **The Black Spider Monkey Haiku**

Black Spider Monkey

Super extremely unique

Endangered species

Let's be honest with ourselvesâ€”is this the most exceptional poetry you've ever encountered? Chances are, it's quite far from that lofty status. However, it does have its own charm and significance.

Despite its simplicity, this short poem managed to transport me back in time to my passions and interests from nearly a decade ago. Reading the haiku stirred up memories and prompted me to rediscover the Black Spiderâ€”a fascinating creature I had long forgotten even existed.

The poem serves as a testament to my past obsession with researching endangered animals. It may not be a literary masterpiece, but it holds a special place in my heart as a reminder of my youthful enthusiasm for wildlife conservation.

Considering how my fascinations have developed in these last eight years, who knows what I might be doing another eight years from now!
