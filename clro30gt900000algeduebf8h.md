In the 4th grade, I spent many hours on my local public library's online system, placing a myriad of books on hold. I wanted to read **everything.**

* An **animal encyclopedia**? I remember staring in astonishment at Australia's Cassowary
    

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>What's a Cassowary</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Cassowaries are the third tallest bird in the world with an adult standing up to six feet tall. The feathers of the body are black and hair-like. The bare skin of the head and fore-neck is blue, while the rear of the neck is red. Also...they're considered the world's most deadly bird.</div></details>

* The **Lord of the Rings** series? I was hooked by the prologue on the history of "The *One Ring*"
    
* **Lunch Lady**? I keep my signed copy from Jarrett J. Krosoczka, the graphic novel's author, on a special pedestal.
    

When I came across a burnt orange cover titled "The Alchemist," it was a no-brainer. I immediately put the book on hold. A week later, it was in the library with a little hold confirmation receipt sticking out. So I brought it home and read it.

The narrative revolves around the journey of an Andalusian shepherd named Santiago. Santiago dreams of a treasure buried near the Egyptian pyramids and decides to pursue it, leaving his comfortable life behind. Along his journey, he meets a series of characters including an old king, an Englishman, and an alchemist, each teaching him about life, love, and the pursuit of one's "Personal Legend"â€”their ultimate purpose or goal in life. This concept of a Personal Legend is a central theme in the book, which brings us to the repeated word "Maktub".

After searching up the book's repeated word "*Maktub*," I learned that its translation was "*It's all written.*" In 2017, I saw it as Coelho's hint at fate's unchangeable, obstinate nature. It made perfect senseâ€”Santiago's Personal Legend would force him on a journey, even if the treasure was back at home.

> *"I can control my destiny, but not my fate. Destiny means there are opportunities to turn right or left, but fate is a one-way street. I believe we all have the choice as to whether we fulfil our destiny, but our fate is sealed.  
> Read more at*" ~ **Paulo Coelho**

I applied the moral to justify my life's journey and all it encompassed as predetermined. I thought my destination was set on being a doctor, like my grandfather. Most things I did were to steer my destiny towards accomplishing that one, preset goal.

By random chance, I came across *The Alchemist* last year in my English teacher's classroom library. Unlike 6 years before, I wasn't sure of being a physician anymore. My daily schedule was now monotonous: go to school, work on homework, manage extracurricular activities, and sleep.

Even though Santiago faced numerous external obstaclesâ€”such as getting burglarized or taken captiveâ€”the majority of his conflicts were internal, much like my own. His predicament was seemingly straightforward; his existence as a shepherd was comfortable and predictable, yet he yearned for more than the daily monotony of wandering with his flock.

I finally found a resolute understanding of the treasure's location under the sycamore tree.

It is a unique journey that each of us is destined to undertake, and it is our responsibility to not only acknowledge it but to overcome our apprehensions and fervently pursue it.

Therefore, a life devoid of this pursuit is one marked by a lingering sense of dissatisfaction, despite outward appearances of contentment, and a perpetual longing for something more.

I believe that I've realized my Personal Legend: to follow my intuitions and worry about the consequences later.

In the next chapter of life, I'm unsure where I might end up. Yet, I'm sure that pursuing my Personal Legend will always keep me hungry for more but satisfied with my growth.

Based on Coelho's words, I guess my Personal Legend also entails meeting *The Alchemist* again.

I'm awaiting another concealed lesson to unearth.
